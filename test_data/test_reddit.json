AITA?\n\nTrying to figure out if my grudge is justified. \n\nMy sister is well known for being extremely cheap. One example is that we swap names for Christmas and set a gift budget of say, $25-30 but she\u2019ll buy something on clearance for $5 marked down from $25 and say that\u2019s the same thing as spending $25. She is in a good position financially, just cheap. \n\nThis happened ages ago but it still really annoys me. She knows that my family loves board games so she called me and said that she\u2019d heard of a board game that she thought I\u2019d really love, but it was $50 and she was only planning on spending $25 on me for Christmas. She asked if I\u2019d send her the extra $25 and she would get it for me. \n\nThe game did sound fun so I agreed. A week or two later, the game arrived - shipped directly from her instead of from a website which was kind of weird, but whatever. Then I opened it and - the game was very clearly used. It looked like they\u2019d played part of a game and stopped in the middle, so there were game pieces and cards and things bundled into ziplock bags with her family\u2019s names written on them as if they\u2019d wanted to pick back up again where they left off. \n\nThe game is super fun and we like it a lot, but it seems very obvious that she got the game, maybe as a gift from someone else, and decided that she didn\u2019t like it so she regifted it to me - that\u2019s not the part that truly bothers me though. The part that makes me furious is that she TOOK MONEY FROM ME to pay for \u201chalf\u201d of a game with the pretense that she was getting me a gift worth the price of a brand new game. \n\nThis was two years ago and I actually cut her out of my life for a completely different reason last year but thinking of it still makes me really upset and I want to know AITA for being so irritated over it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq", "subreddit_subscribers": 2668770, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "AITA for being upset that my sister cheaped out on a gift for me?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/mswl48/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_sister_cheaped_out/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "suggested_sort": null, "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "link_flair_css_class": null}

I explain it isn't something that really interests me, and she goes OFF. She starts talking about how it's disrespectful to the entire culture, and how it's similar to cultural appropriation. And she finishes the rant off saying I should apologize to her. I decide that I should ask the other members of my family who are also into this stuff, their view.

I just got back from traveling with a group of friends.. this trip has put a lot of things into perspective for me.

Use to be closer but after one of my friends and I fell out a few years ago it was never the same. This was the friend (let\u2019s call her Ashley) that I was closest to and knew since middle school. I won\u2019t go into detail about why we fell out but just know, she is someone who completely lacks self awareness and is very inconsiderate of others. After we fell out, I started hanging out with Ashley\u2019s best friend who I felt like I could relate to more, let\u2019s call her Stephanie.\n\n\n\nSo out of the friend group, Ashley is the one who acts like she\u2019s better than people. She talks to everyone like they\u2019re dumb and ALWAYS makes slick comments and tries to one up you, it\u2019s incredibly annoying and that\u2019s what people have to put up with when they\u2019re around her. She especially likes to show out when other people are around, like she acts one way with me when we\u2019re by ourself and one way when we\u2019re around other people. She always thinks she can make snide remarks about others with no remorse because shes a Capricorn and that\u2019s apart of their personality(her words, not mine). You can tell that Ashley thinks she\u2019s the ring leader amongst the 3 of them, like it\u2019s so obvious. Sometimes they will base their decisions off of what they think Ashley wants. Stephanie and i have discussed Ashley\u2019s ways before because we know how she is as a person.\n\nAfter taking this trip with all of them, I realized I have no interest in being around them anymore. We are all 25+ but they still act like children and sometimes I think they\u2019re too intimidated by Ashley to stick up for themselves. Sometimes I feel like Stephanie tries to \u201cplay me\u201d in front of Ashley for some odd reason and I know I\u2019m not exaggerating. Like, I could be asking the group a simple question and Stephanie will be like \u201cwtf are you talking about\u201d OR she\u2019ll be like \u201cOP stfu...\u201d, it BUGS me because she does not act like this went Ashley isn\u2019t around! And the kicker is that Ashley can say something rude to her and she won\u2019t say anything to defend herself or she\u2019ll just roll her eyes. Like the other day while we were headed back to our room, Stephanie caught an attitude about something and ashely said \u201cummm you can shut up....troll-rat\u201d. Stephanie didn\u2019t mumble a word. Now I understand some people do play with their friends like that but this is coming from someone who use to call Stephanie \u201cblack ass\u201d and all other types of names because she was dark skin (ashley is light skin and blasian). I just don\u2019t do the name calling with friends because it can send the wrong message.\n\nAnother situation that happened over the trip was while we were all out at brunch. I originally dressed up in a cute two piece but it was chilly outside so I went to the car to change into another spare outfit that I bought with me. It was just a two piece sweat suit with a hoodie and sweat shorts. As soon as I got back to the table, everyone was complimenting me on how cute my outfit looked. I overheard Ashley whisper to her boyfriend (who she decided she would invite to the GIRLS trip) \u201cyeah but she put shorts on which defeats the whole purpose\u201d. Even though I was much warmer in that outfit than I was before, I didn\u2019t understand why she made that comment. Almost as if she was trying to \u201chumble me\u201d in a way. \n\nOne time while we were all sitting around the table, it was kinda silent so Ashley decided to randomly throw a bottle top at Stephanies head, thinking it would be funny. Stephanie didn\u2019t laugh, she just looked at Ashley like she was stupid and Ashley turns as says \u201coh my bad I meant to throw it at the back of your head, not the front\u201d. Ashelys boufriend seemed taken aback by this and said \u201cso you\u2019re not going to apologize\u201d and Ashley says \u201cnope\u201d. I guess she thought it was funny but stuff like that is really childish to me like wtf. Why throw something at someone\u2019s head \n\nSorry for the long post but I just needed to vent.

At the time she was seeing this guy that she met about a month beforehand. He was an older guy and he seemed pretty cool. I did not think she liked him that much, just someone she was dating at the time. Plus he was gointhrough a divorce.\n\nOne weekend, all of us ended up hanging out together and had a pretty fun time together. That following week, i received a text message from her telling me that she was pregnant. I was shocked! My best friend and I always talked about how we weren\u2019t ready for kids yet but I always knew she wanted to have kids whenever because she loves children. I, on the other hand, was always convinced that I would try to have kids after I turn 30.\n\nSo I ended up texting her back and said \u201cwow!\u201d \u201cwhat are you going to do?\u201d At the time, I was kinda nervous for her. I didn\u2019t know if she wanted kids at the time. Of course she told me she wanted to keep it but, as I think back on it, maybe that wasn\u2019t the best response. I probably should\u2019ve just said congratulations but like I said, I didn\u2019t think she wanted children at the moment, especially not with the guy that she was with.

When I finally got a boyfriend, I noticed that she would make comments about how I should have a baby and how great babies are. Now I\u2019m not saying babies aren\u2019t great but why would someone say this and she doesn\u2019t have any babies of her own. She said she wants a baby because she feels like it would motivate her yet (which is another story) but every time she has a pregnancy scare, she runs to the doctor to make sure she\u2019s not pregnant. Idk, maybe I\u2019m looking too deep into this but I just find it weird that she would keep saying that I should have a baby, knowing that I don\u2019t really care for children lol\n\nMy boyfriends younger cousin who he\u2019s very close to also gives him questionable \u201cadvice\u201d as well. This cousin is very quirky and socially awkward, he is also a MGTOW/incel guy.

I think he was trying to make my boyfriend feel insecure or something.\n\nThere was also a situation last year where my boyfriend was about to change his major to a field that had more opportunities and was more lucrative. He was originally trying to be an environmental engineer, but taking one extra class would allow him to change to civil engineering instead. I encouraged him to take the extra class because he\u2019d have more job opportunities. When he told his cousin about it, he said that he seemed disappointed because \u201che thought he was going to be an environmental engineer\u201d. That was strange to me as well.\n\nNow i understand that everyone has a different way of viewing things so these people could be giving advice that they truly feel is right but I just can\u2019t help but to feel like there is malicious intent behind certain peoples \u201cadvice\u201d.

I will admit that I did not clean them as often as I should, TBH I was cleaning them maybe three times a week. (Don\u2019t judge me) so after she told me that I made it a point to buy some actual lash cleanser and start cleaning my lashes every day, one time in the morning at one time at night. \n\nI have noticed a difference in the longevity of my lashes basting left here and I feel like I have retain more lashes this time around. When I went to my appointment today, my lash tech said that my lashes looked OK but they lost their \u201ccurl\u201d and looked pretty straight. I was pretty confused because I\u2019ve been doing all the things that she told me to do at my last appt. She said that it could be the heat from when I blow dry my hair or from when I cook. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s the case because I blow dry my hair maybe once a week and I cook one 1-2 times a week. I will say that I do smoke every day but I\u2019m not sure if that would be the reason why my lashes have lost their curl. \n\nHave any of you ever experienced his and can tell me how to stop this from happening?

Things started off kind of shaky with his mother but she treats me nicely now (to my face). \n\nMy BFs mom displayed typical behavior when I met her.. she did not smile when he finally introduced her to me and whenever my bf walked out the room, she stared me straight in the face and said \u201cyeah that\u2019s MY little man\u201d which was his nickname as a child. I was so uncomfortable because I could sense the hostility when she said it. Not even 5 minutes of me meeting her, she starts drilling me with questions about what I do and where I worked. I felt like she was trying to size me up. For background info, my bf told me that his mom always taught him growing up to be careful about women because they will try to \u201ctrap\u201d him and put him on child support. I get that she was trying to scare him into being safe but Im sure she viewed me this same way. Whenever we started dating, I overheard his aunt on the phone telling him not to move out with me when he graduates because \u201cthe first thing they try to do is get pregnant\u201d. It also doesn\u2019t help that my boyfriend is an engineer lol but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m beneath him because I have my masters degree and i have a good job now.\n\nTo make a long story short, there has been some drama in their family regarding him dating me. There have been rumors about me being pregnant (which I\u2019m not) and that we planned on running off and eloping (which we don\u2019t).   His mom was so upset by the eloping \u201crumor\u201d that she told her coworker who ended up inviting my BF to her house and tryna \u201ctalk some sense into him\u201d. Not going to lie, this pissed me off. Her coworker told my boyfriend that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have to settle\u201d and asked him to pray with her. It was weird and I was pissed at the fact that his mom tried to enlist her coworker to do HER dirty work. \nHis mother also randomly called him one time last year after we left their house and told him not to get me pregnant because she didn\u2019t wanted grandkids. \n\nIt hasn\u2019t been all drama with their family though, but the few incidents that have gone on really made me take a step back. My boyfriend knows how his family is and does not condone their behavior whatsoever. He tells me all the time how mean and two-faced his mom and aunt are and I think that\u2019s his way of warning me about them.\n\nWell for the past few months, my boyfriend and I have been entertaining the idea of moving into an apartment together. He just started his job and he says he\u2019s ready to move out of his parents house and I am too. While we\u2019ve been trying to find an apartment to rent, I\u2019ve been wondering what his mother thinks about the idea. I\u2019m honestly surprised that she hasn\u2019t tried to secretly call me and insinuate that she hopes that I wasn\u2019t pressuring him, which she has done several times in the past.\n\nWhen my boyfriend came over yesterday, he told me That his mom asked him yesterday if he still planned on moving out. She asked him if he was sure about moving out and he said yes. She then goes on to tell him that she thinks that he should wait to the beginning of the year because that\u2019s when most people move out for a \u201cfresh start\u201d. Obviously she\u2019s trying to sew seeds of doubt in his head about moving out with me. She also said \u201cwell I just don\u2019t want any grandkids....\u201d. \n\nLike wtf? We aren\u2019t even trying to have kids right now..and if we were, I\u2019m totally of age to do so! It just pisses me off that she always makes these little comments, I try to be understanding and realize that she\u2019s just a concerned mother but I\u2019m starting to feel like she\u2019s just manipulative.\n\nIf anyone could offer any words of advice, it would be greatly appreciated because I\u2019m almost at the point where I don\u2019t want to be around his family anymore.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "JUSTNOMIL", "subreddit_id": "t5_377ps", "subreddit_subscribers": 1747174, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My MIL is trying to sew seeds of doubts about us moving out together.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/m67xc2/my_mil_is_trying_to_sew_seeds_of_doubts_about_us/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "link_flair_template_id": "ec932b26-655b-11e9-aeca-0e7bf9a83192", "link_flair_text": "RANT (\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b Advice Wanted", "suggested_sort": "new", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "link_flair_css_class": null}

When I was younger, I remember coming home after a short trip to find that my mom re-arranged my room or bought me a new comforter set. \n\nOf course I appreciated it then (bc i had no money or my own taste) but she still does it and I can\u2019t get her to stop. For example, I just got back from a trip and saw that she bought another rug for my room. It was so ugly and just not something I would have in my room. I moved the rug out immediately and asked her (for the 50th time) not to buy anything for me. Im a grown adult and like to decorate things on my own She told me that it hurt her feelings that I didn\u2019t want the rug but I\u2019m more so irritated by the fact that she continues to do this after I have to beg her not to.\n\nThis might sound petty because I should be grateful that my mom gets things for me but I just think this crosses my boundaries and I can\u2019t get her to stop. She just can\u2019t seem to grasp the idea that I do not want her decorating for me because I like things done my way.

I just got back from traveling with a group of friends.. this trip has put a lot of things into perspective for me. I went on a trip with 3 of my friends that I\u2019ve known since middle school/high school and one of their boyfriends. All 3 of them are best friends and I\u2019m just a \u201cclose friend\u201d. Use to be closer but after one of my friends and I fell out a few years ago it was never the same. This was the friend (let\u2019s call her Ashley) that I was closest to and knew since middle school. I won\u2019t go into detail about why we fell out but just know, she is someone who completely lacks self awareness and is very inconsiderate of others. After we fell out, I started hanging out with Ashley\u2019s best friend who I felt like I could relate to more, let\u2019s call her Stephanie.\n\n\n\nSo out of the friend group, Ashley is the one who acts like she\u2019s better than people. She talks to everyone like they\u2019re dumb and ALWAYS makes slick comments and tries to one up you, it\u2019s incredibly annoying and that\u2019s what people have to put up with when they\u2019re around her. She especially likes to show out when other people are around, like she acts one way with me when we\u2019re by ourself and one way when we\u2019re around other people. She always thinks she can make snide remarks about others with no remorse because shes a Capricorn and that\u2019s apart of their personality(her words, not mine). You can tell that Ashley thinks she\u2019s the ring leader amongst the 3 of them, like it\u2019s so obvious. Sometimes they will base their decisions off of what they think Ashley wants. Stephanie and i have discussed Ashley\u2019s ways before because we know how she is as a person.\n\nAfter taking this trip with all of them, I realized I have no interest in being around them anymore. We are all 25+ but they still act like children and sometimes I think they\u2019re too intimidated by Ashley to stick up for themselves. Sometimes I feel like Stephanie tries to \u201cplay me\u201d in front of Ashley for some odd reason and I know I\u2019m not exaggerating. Like, I could be asking the group a simple question and Stephanie will be like \u201cwtf are you talking about\u201d OR she\u2019ll be like \u201cOP stfu...\u201d, it BUGS me because she does not act like this went Ashley isn\u2019t around! And the kicker is that Ashley can say something rude to her and she won\u2019t say anything to defend herself or she\u2019ll just roll her eyes. Like the other day while we were headed back to our room, Stephanie caught an attitude about something and ashely said \u201cummm you can shut up....troll-rat\u201d. Stephanie didn\u2019t mumble a word. Now I understand some people do play with their friends like that but this is coming from someone who use to call Stephanie \u201cblack ass\u201d and all other types of names because she was dark skin (ashley is light skin and blasian). I just don\u2019t do the name calling with friends because it can send the wrong message.\n\nAnother situation that happened over the trip was while we were all out at brunch. I originally dressed up in a cute two piece but it was chilly outside so I went to the car to change into another spare outfit that I bought with me. It was just a two piece sweat suit with a hoodie and sweat shorts. As soon as I got back to the table, everyone was complimenting me on how cute my outfit looked. I overheard Ashley whisper to her boyfriend (who she decided she would invite to the GIRLS trip) \u201cyeah but she put shorts on which defeats the whole purpose\u201d. Even though I was much warmer in that outfit than I was before, I didn\u2019t understand why she made that comment. Almost as if she was trying to \u201chumble me\u201d in a way. \n\nOne time while we were all sitting around the table, it was kinda silent so Ashley decided to randomly throw a bottle top at Stephanies head, thinking it would be funny. Stephanie didn\u2019t laugh, she just looked at Ashley like she was stupid and Ashley turns as says \u201coh my bad I meant to throw it at the back of your head, not the front\u201d. Ashelys boufriend seemed taken aback by this and said \u201cso you\u2019re not going to apologize\u201d and Ashley says \u201cnope\u201d. I guess she thought it was funny but stuff like that is really childish to me like wtf. Why throw something at someone\u2019s head \n\nSorry for the long post but I just needed to vent.

At the time she was seeing this guy that she met about a month beforehand. He was an older guy and he seemed pretty cool. I did not think she liked him that much, just someone she was dating at the time. Plus he was gointhrough a divorce.\n\nOne weekend, all of us ended up hanging out together and had a pretty fun time together. That following week, i received a text message from her telling me that she was pregnant. I was shocked! My best friend and I always talked about how we weren\u2019t ready for kids yet but I always knew she wanted to have kids whenever because she loves children. I, on the other hand, was always convinced that I would try to have kids after I turn 30.\n\nSo I ended up texting her back and said \u201cwow!\u201d \u201cwhat are you going to do?\u201d At the time, I was kinda nervous for her. I didn\u2019t know if she wanted kids at the time. Of course she told me she wanted to keep it but, as I think back on it, maybe that wasn\u2019t the best response. I probably should\u2019ve just said congratulations but like I said, I didn\u2019t think she wanted children at the moment, especially not with the guy that she was with.

When I finally got a boyfriend, I noticed that she would make comments about how I should have a baby and how great babies are. Now I\u2019m not saying babies aren\u2019t great but why would someone say this and she doesn\u2019t have any babies of her own. She said she wants a baby because she feels like it would motivate her yet (which is another story) but every time she has a pregnancy scare, she runs to the doctor to make sure she\u2019s not pregnant. Idk, maybe I\u2019m looking too deep into this but I just find it weird that she would keep saying that I should have a baby, knowing that I don\u2019t really care for children lol\n\nMy boyfriends younger cousin who he\u2019s very close to also gives him questionable \u201cadvice\u201d as well. This cousin is very quirky and socially awkward, he is also a MGTOW/incel guy.

I think he was trying to make my boyfriend feel insecure or something.\n\nThere was also a situation last year where my boyfriend was about to change his major to a field that had more opportunities and was more lucrative. He was originally trying to be an environmental engineer, but taking one extra class would allow him to change to civil engineering instead. I encouraged him to take the extra class because he\u2019d have more job opportunities. When he told his cousin about it, he said that he seemed disappointed because \u201che thought he was going to be an environmental engineer\u201d. That was strange to me as well.\n\nNow i understand that everyone has a different way of viewing things so these people could be giving advice that they truly feel is right but I just can\u2019t help but to feel like there is malicious intent behind certain peoples \u201cadvice\u201d.

I will admit that I did not clean them as often as I should, TBH I was cleaning them maybe three times a week. (Don\u2019t judge me) so after she told me that I made it a point to buy some actual lash cleanser and start cleaning my lashes every day, one time in the morning at one time at night. \n\nI have noticed a difference in the longevity of my lashes basting left here and I feel like I have retain more lashes this time around. When I went to my appointment today, my lash tech said that my lashes looked OK but they lost their \u201ccurl\u201d and looked pretty straight. I was pretty confused because I\u2019ve been doing all the things that she told me to do at my last appt. She said that it could be the heat from when I blow dry my hair or from when I cook. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s the case because I blow dry my hair maybe once a week and I cook one 1-2 times a week. I will say that I do smoke every day but I\u2019m not sure if that would be the reason why my lashes have lost their curl. \n\nHave any of you ever experienced his and can tell me how to stop this from happening?

Things started off kind of shaky with his mother but she treats me nicely now (to my face). \n\nMy BFs mom displayed typical behavior when I met her.. she did not smile when he finally introduced her to me and whenever my bf walked out the room, she stared me straight in the face and said \u201cyeah that\u2019s MY little man\u201d which was his nickname as a child. I was so uncomfortable because I could sense the hostility when she said it. Not even 5 minutes of me meeting her, she starts drilling me with questions about what I do and where I worked. I felt like she was trying to size me up. For background info, my bf told me that his mom always taught him growing up to be careful about women because they will try to \u201ctrap\u201d him and put him on child support. I get that she was trying to scare him into being safe but Im sure she viewed me this same way. Whenever we started dating, I overheard his aunt on the phone telling him not to move out with me when he graduates because \u201cthe first thing they try to do is get pregnant\u201d. It also doesn\u2019t help that my boyfriend is an engineer lol but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m beneath him because I have my masters degree and i have a good job now.\n\nTo make a long story short, there has been some drama in their family regarding him dating me. There have been rumors about me being pregnant (which I\u2019m not) and that we planned on running off and eloping (which we don\u2019t).   His mom was so upset by the eloping \u201crumor\u201d that she told her coworker who ended up inviting my BF to her house and tryna \u201ctalk some sense into him\u201d. Not going to lie, this pissed me off. Her coworker told my boyfriend that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have to settle\u201d and asked him to pray with her. It was weird and I was pissed at the fact that his mom tried to enlist her coworker to do HER dirty work. \nHis mother also randomly called him one time last year after we left their house and told him not to get me pregnant because she didn\u2019t wanted grandkids. \n\nIt hasn\u2019t been all drama with their family though, but the few incidents that have gone on really made me take a step back. My boyfriend knows how his family is and does not condone their behavior whatsoever. He tells me all the time how mean and two-faced his mom and aunt are and I think that\u2019s his way of warning me about them.\n\nWell for the past few months, my boyfriend and I have been entertaining the idea of moving into an apartment together. He just started his job and he says he\u2019s ready to move out of his parents house and I am too. While we\u2019ve been trying to find an apartment to rent, I\u2019ve been wondering what his mother thinks about the idea. I\u2019m honestly surprised that she hasn\u2019t tried to secretly call me and insinuate that she hopes that I wasn\u2019t pressuring him, which she has done several times in the past.\n\nWhen my boyfriend came over yesterday, he told me That his mom asked him yesterday if he still planned on moving out. She asked him if he was sure about moving out and he said yes. She then goes on to tell him that she thinks that he should wait to the beginning of the year because that\u2019s when most people move out for a \u201cfresh start\u201d. Obviously she\u2019s trying to sew seeds of doubt in his head about moving out with me. She also said \u201cwell I just don\u2019t want any grandkids....\u201d. \n\nLike wtf? We aren\u2019t even trying to have kids right now..and if we were, I\u2019m totally of age to do so! It just pisses me off that she always makes these little comments, I try to be understanding and realize that she\u2019s just a concerned mother but I\u2019m starting to feel like she\u2019s just manipulative.\n\nIf anyone could offer any words of advice, it would be greatly appreciated because I\u2019m almost at the point where I don\u2019t want to be around his family anymore.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "JUSTNOMIL", "subreddit_id": "t5_377ps", "subreddit_subscribers": 1747174, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My MIL is trying to sew seeds of doubts about us moving out together.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/m67xc2/my_mil_is_trying_to_sew_seeds_of_doubts_about_us/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0, "removed_by_category": null, "link_flair_template_id": "ec932b26-655b-11e9-aeca-0e7bf9a83192", "link_flair_text": "RANT (\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b Advice Wanted", "suggested_sort": "new", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "link_flair_css_class": null}
